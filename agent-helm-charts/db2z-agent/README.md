# IBM Db2 for z/OS Agent

## Overview
IBM Db2 for z/OS Agent is an AI-powered assistant that enables you to easily obtain real-time information about your Db2 for z/OS subsystems and database objects through a simple prompt-based conversational interface. For example, you can ask it what the current value of a particular subsystem parameter is, which buffer pool a particular index uses, or if any utilities are currently running on a subsystem. In addition to providing a response, the agent also explains the method that it used to obtain the response.

## Architecture support
IBM Db2 for z/OS Agent is currently supported on `x86_64` architecture.

# Prerequisites:
- [watsonx Assistant for Z](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watsonx/waz/2.0.0?topic=install-watsonx-assistant-z)
- Db2 for z/OS v13
* ODBC connectivity to Db2 for z/OS
  - Server verification is recommended but client verification is supported by mounting the license into the deployed container at
    `/usr/local/lib64/python3.12/site-packages/clidriver/license`
* A watsonx api key, which is used as the value for the WATSONX_API_KEY environment variable
  - Configured as `WATSONX_API_KEY` environment variable.
* A watsonx Deployment Space ID or Project ID.
  - See [create deployment space](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watsonx/w-and-w/2.1.0?topic=spaces-creating-deployment) for instructions. To get the `space GUID`, open your deployment space, and click the `Manage` tab.
  - Use this value as `WATSONX_DEPLOYMENT_SPACE_ID` or `WATSONX_PROJECT_ID` environment variable.


## Install the IBM Db2 for z/OS Agent


### Retrieve the entitlement key

An entitlement key is required to download the Db2 for z/OS Agent container image from the IBM Container Registry. This entitlement key is available at no charge to licensed users of Db2 13.
 
* To obtain the entitlement key, open a case with IBM Support indicating that you are requesting the entitlement key for IBM Db2 for z/OS Agent.
 
Set the global entitlement key using the watsonx Assistant for Z entitlement key:

```yaml
global:
  registry:
    name: wxa4z-image-pull-secret
    createSecret: true
    server: icr.io
    username: iamapikey
    entitlementKey: "<WATSONX_ASSISTANT_FOR_Z_ENTITLEMENT_KEY>"
```

### Create Shared Variables

Certain variables are common across all agents. To configure these shared variables, refer to [Create shared variables](https://github.com/IBM/z-ai-agents?tab=readme-ov-file#1-global-settings) (link to the global GitHub page).
However, if any of these shared variables are also defined in your agent-specific [values.yaml](https://github.com/IBM/z-ai-agents/blob/main/agent-helm-charts/db2z-agent/values.yaml) file, the values specified in the values.yaml file will override the shared ones.

### Configure the values.yaml file

To enable the IBM Db2 for z/OS Agent, you need to configure agent-specific values in the [values.yaml](https://github.com/IBM/z-ai-agents/blob/main/wxa4z-agent-suite/values.yaml) file.

In the values.yaml file, scroll down to the IBM Db2 for z/OS Agent section and update the keys as outlined in the following table.

| Key       |            Description                  |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------|

## Generating an encrypt key with Python

### Step 1: Install the package cryptography via pip and run python
```bash
pip install cryptography
python
```

### Step 2: Generate the key in python terminal
```python
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
Fernet.generate_key()
```      


### Storage
To use persistent storage, set `pvc.enabled` to true and adjust the `pvc.size`, `pvc.storageClass`, and `pvc.accessModes` settings as needed. 

### Resources
Configure `resources.limits` and `resources.requests` to configure the CPU and memory resources for your deployment. 


### Install or upgrade the wxa4z-agent-suite

> **Note**:- If you're installing multiple agents, you can configure the [values.yaml](https://github.com/IBM/z-ai-agents/blob/main/wxa4z-agent-suite/values.yaml) file for all the agents you wish to install. Once the file is updated, run the command below to install them all at once.


Use the following command to install or upgrade the wxa4z_agent_suite:

```yaml
helm upgrade --install wxa4z-agent-suite \
  ./wxa4z-agent-suite \
  -n <wxa4z-namespace> \
  -f <path_to>/values.yaml --wait
```


## Deploy your agent

1. Log in to watsonx Orchestrate.
2. From the main menu, navigate to **Build** > **Agent Builder**.
3. Select the **IBM Db2 for z/OS Agent** tile.
4. In the AI Assistant window, enter a query to confirm that the response aligns with your expectations.
5. Click **Deploy** to activate the agent and make it available in the live environment.


## Test your agent

After deployment, the agent becomes active and is available for selection in the live environment.

1. From the main menu, click **Chat**.
2. Choose your agent from the list.
3. Enter your queries using the AI Assistant.
   For example:
   
      - What are the bufferpool sizes of all my Db2 subsystems?

      - Show me all the indexes under DSN81310 in DWY1.

      - Please retrieve all indexes from utec648.vmec.svl.ibm.com/STLEC1.

    Responses are displayed either in a tabular format or as a sentence, depending on the context.

4. Verify that the responses returned by the AI Assistant are accurate.
