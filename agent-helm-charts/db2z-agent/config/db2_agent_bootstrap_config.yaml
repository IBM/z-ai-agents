          description: The Db2 for z/OS agent provides a conversational experience for interacting with Db2 for z/OS subsystems, making it significantly easier to retrieve and interpret information across multiple Db2 for z/OS environments. By reducing the complexity traditionally associated with navigating system configurations, comparing subsystem data, and handling large volumes of technical information, the agent empowers both technical and non-technical users to gain meaningful insightsâ€”without requiring deep expertise in Db2 for z/OS command syntax.
