| Description   | Answers questions about CICS® regions, CICSPlexes, sysplexes, LPARs, and workloads in z/OS environments. Tracks CPU utilization, I/O activity, transaction volumes, response times, and storage availability, and detects high-consuming transactions or short-on-storage conditions. Monitors limits, such as maximum tasks (MAXTASKS) and concurrent transactions, to give visibility into active CICSPlexes, their regions, and transaction classes. For sysplexes and LPARs, the agent provides information about CPU health, utilization, and system topology, and validates resource existence. Delivers z/OS Workload Management (WLM) insights, including transaction rates, response times, performance indexes, and goal achievements, and highlights service classes that are not meeting objectives. Reports critical events and critical event groups. |

## Prerequisites
The following software must be installed and configured:

- [IBM watsonx Assistant for Z](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watsonx/waz/2.0.0?topic=install-watsonx-assistant-z)
- IBM Concert for Z (https://www.ibm.com/docs/z-concert)

## Image Signature Verification Guide

This container image of the **IBM Operations Agent for Z** is digitally signed to guarantee authenticity and integrity.
Use the following instructions to verify the image signature with the provided files.

---

### Image reference

```bash
icr.io/ibm-operations-ai/ibm-operations-agent-for-z:v1.1.0
```
### Files provided

- **PRD0014680key.pem.cer** – Certificate
- **PRD0014680key.pem.chain** – CA chain
- **PRD0014680key.pem.pub.key** – Public key

---

### Prerequisites

Before you begin signature verification, ensure that the following command-line tools are installed:

- **cosign**: For verifying the container signature
- **jq**: A lightweight JSON processor
- **crane**: For inspecting image manifests
- **OpenSSL**: For cryptographic checks on the certificate and public key

---

### Quick Verification

To immediately verify the image signature, run the following command:

```bash
cosign verify --key PRD0014680key.pem.pub.key \
  icr.io/ibm-operations-ai/ibm-operations-agent-for-z:v1.1.0 | jq .
```

If the signature is valid, details about the signer and the certificate are shown in the output.

## Optional: Detailed Verification Steps

### 1. Check Signature Manifest

Identify the signature manifest reference:

```bash
cosign triangulate icr.io/ibm-operations-ai/ibm-operations-agent-for-z:v1.1.0
```
Example output:

```bash
icr.io/ibm-operations-ai/ibm-operations-agent-for-z:sha256-<digest>.sig
```
Inspect the signature details:

```bash
crane manifest icr.io/ibm-operations-ai/ibm-operations-agent-for-z:sha256-<digest>.sig | jq .
```
This displays the certificate chain and metadata that is embedded in the signature object.

### 2. Ensure that the public key and the certificate match.

Compare the public key and certificate by inspecting their modulus and exponent:

```bash
openssl x509 -in PRD0014680key.pem.cer -noout -text
openssl rsa -noout -text -inform PEM -in PRD0014680key.pem.pub.key -pubin
```
Look for the modulus and exponent values, which must match across both outputs.
A match of these values confirms that the public key corresponds to the signing certificate.

### 3. Verify that the provided certificate is valid.

Use the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) to verify the certificate.
This sends a request to the Certificate Authority (DigiCert) to confirm the certificate status.

```bash
openssl ocsp -no_nonce \
  -issuer PRD0014680key.pem.chain \
  -cert PRD0014680key.pem.cer \
  -VAfile PRD0014680key.pem.chain \
  -url http://ocsp.digicert.com \
  -respout ocsptest -text
```
If the certificate is valid, the output will include:

```bash
Response verify OK
```

### Step 1: Create ICR Pull Secret (First-Time Setup)

Run the following command to create an image pull secret for IBM Cloud Container Registry (ICR):

```bash
oc create secret -n <your-namespace> docker-registry ibm-operations-agent-z-secrets \
  --docker-server=icr.io \  #replace this with container registry
  --docker-username=iamapikey \ # replace this with container registry username
  --docker-password=<your-api-key> # replace this with container registry password
```

> Replace <your-namespace> and <your-api-key> with your specific namespace and API key.


---

### Step 2: Update pull secret in `values.yaml`

In your Helm chart's[ `values.yaml`] , update the image pull secret:

```yaml
imagePullSecrets:
  - name: ibm-operations-agent-z-secrets
```

---

### Step 3: Install Helm Chart

Finally, install the Helm chart:

```bash
helm upgrade --install ibm-operations-agent-z . \
  -n <your-namespace> \
  -f values.yaml
```
> **Note**: If you want to install the agent standalone on an OpenShift cluster without wxa4z-operator, agent registration should be done through UI refer the official guidance [Adding AI assistants from external AI agents](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watsonx/watson-orchestrate/current?topic=agent-adding-ai-assistants-ai-chat#external-agents)
---

## Install or upgrade the wxa4z-agent-suite

> **Note**: If you're installing multiple agents, you can configure the [values.yaml](https://github.com/IBM/z-ai-agents/blob/main/wxa4z-agent-suite/values.yaml) file for all the agents you wish to install. Once the file is updated, run the command below to install them all at once.


Use the following command to install or upgrade the wxa4z_agent_suite:

```yaml
helm upgrade --install wxa4z-agent-suite \
  ./wxa4z-agent-suite \
  -n <wxa4z-namespace> \
  -f <path_to>/values.yaml --wait
```

## Enabling the Agent and Accepting the License

The WXA4Z-suite install will only install the IBM Operations Agent for Z if it is enabled and the license is accepted. To enable IBM Operations Agent for Z change the values of the following keys:

The enabled key should be set to true.
The acceptLicense key should be set to true. Setting this to true implies that you agree to the license terms.
These values are available in the shared [values.yaml](../../wxa4z-agent-suite/values.yaml).


```bash
ibm-operations-agent-z:
  enabled: true
  acceptLicense: true
```
